# Overview of Duolingo Courses

This is a copy of my lists that I created and periodically updated on the duolingo forum. The web version of the lists is available [here](https://liuch.github.io/duolingo_courses_overview/).

## Repository content

- The `markdown` directory contains source files with the lists that I've posted on the forum.
- The `html` directory contains the files that was gotten with my utils from the markdown files to display them on the page I have metioned above. They are referenced by `index.html`.
- The `utils` directory contains some scripts that I used to get hmtl files from my markdown files. These script do not modify `index.html` file.
- The `css` and 'js' directory are for web version of the overview.

## How to use it

You are free to use these lists as you see fit without any restrictions, including to improve them. If you find errors or inaccuracies, please let me know in the issues, I will try to fix them. You can also send me a pull request.
